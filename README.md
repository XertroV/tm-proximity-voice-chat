# tm-proximity-voice-chat

Proximity voice chat via mumble. A mumble server is provided.
See the plugin for the setup wizard.

You will need:
- [Mumble](https://mumble.info/)
- [the TM to Mumble Link app](https://openplanet.dev/file/122)
- The plugin

There is some light configuration of mumble to do in order to enable positional audio.
(You'll also need to set mumble up how you like it wrt devices etc.)

Features:
- Channels based on game server or map uid (for solo)
  - Also separate channels for teams in team games
- Configurable voice/ears location (useful if helping someone in cam7 on an RPG, for example)
- *Future feature:* Custom club room settings to control voice/ears locations for players (e.g., maybe spectators' voices should not appear at the camera, which is otherwise the default)
- Integrated wizard to help you set things up
- and probably some other things I forgot atm.
